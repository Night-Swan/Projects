## Usage
1. Input: The code requires a graph file as input.
2. Isomorphism Checking: The code checks if it contains GI in the name and then checks if graphs in the input file are isomorphic to each other.
3. Automorphism Calculation: The code checks if it contains Aut in the name and then calculates the number of automorphisms of a given graph.
4. If a file has both GI and Aut in its name or contains neither then it calculates both the isomorphic graphs and the number of automorphisms of each graph.

## Running the Code
1. Prepare Input File: Provide a .grl file containing graphs as input.
2. Set File Path: Update the filepath variable in the script with the path to your input file.
3. Run the Script: Execute the script. Results will be printed to the console.
